        <h2>About this site</h2>

        <p>This site introduces apps created by N.M.Triec - an Android developer.<br/>
          The products introduced on this site include apps which are to be submitted on Android Apps Store soon in this year. 
          Other projects that come later would appear at suitable time depending on their completion processes.
        </p>

        <h3>Word-Player app</h3>

        <p>
          Helps you learn the English words. In the app, you need to rewrite the original words which have been
          randomly scrambled. There are 3 level of difficulty: Easy, Medium, Challenge for your choice.
          It's very simple, but with every level up you will develop more for your English vocabulary.
          Happy learning! And have nice experience with this app.
        </p>
        <h3>Bookshelf app</h3>
        <p>
          Bookshelf app uses Google Book Service to provide you  a fast access to books of your interest.  
          When you input a query text (e.g. Einstein, London, Python, Mekong River...), the app would search 
          and show a grid of books in pictures (the front covers of the books) corresponding to query content. 
          From pictures you can get some important information such as book titles, authors' name, year of 
          publication. If you are interest in a specific book, you can click on its picture to move to book 
          preview with wide variety of information on this book.
