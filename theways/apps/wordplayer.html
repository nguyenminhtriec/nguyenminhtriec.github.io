                <h3>About this app</h3>
                <hr/>
                This app helps you learn the most popular 1000 words in English.
                In the app, you will rewrite English words from the letters that was formed by scrambling corresponding words.
                There are 3 level of difficulty: Easy, Medium, Challenging for your choice.<br/><br/>
                HOW TO USE <br/>
                >> Choose the level to start.<br/>
                >> Rewrite the right word using all the letters showing in the screen (scrambled word).<br/>
                >> Submit your word / or Skip to go to next word. You also get a hint: the app then shows the first letter 
                of the right word for you.<br/><br/>
                HOW TO RATE YOUR WORK<br/>
                >> Each section has 10 words to do.<br/>
                >> For a specific word, you get 10 marks if correct without hint, 5 marks with a hint, 0 mark if you skip.<br/>
                >> No time limit for each word.<br/>
                >> Only one time of hint for each word.<br/><br/>
                REMARK<br/>
                To get marks at a specific word, you must enter the right word that matches the word in the list of 1000 words of the app. Sometimes, the word you input look good (it uses all letters of the scrambled word and is an in English word in dictionary), but you cannot score marks. For example, the scramble word is "PTSO", the right word would be "STOP", not "POST" or "SPOT".
                It's very simple, but with every level up you will develop more for your English vocabulary.

                Happy learning! And have nice experience with this app.<br/><br/>
